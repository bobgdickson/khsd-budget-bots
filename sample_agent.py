# This file shows the basic building blocks of an agent + tool combo.

# --------------------------
# ðŸ§° TOOL: Word Counter
# --------------------------
# Tools are functions the AI agent can call to help it perform a task.
# Tools can be API calls, database queries, parsers, calculators, etc.
# This one just counts the number of words in a string.

class WordCountResult(BaseModel):
    word_count: int
    success: bool
    message: str

    """
    Count the number of words in the input string.
    The input will usually come from the user or from another tool.
    """
    try:
        num_words = len(input.strip().split())
        return WordCountResult(
            word_count=num_words,

        )

# --------------------------
# ðŸ§  AGENT: Text Summarizer
# --------------------------
# This is where we define the agent's behavior.
# Think of it like writing the AI's job description.

    model="gpt-4.1-mini",  # You can change this to try different OpenAI models
    output_type=str,  # The agent should return a plain string
)

# --------------------------
# ðŸš€ RUNNER FUNCTION
# --------------------------
# This is the code that actually runs the agent on a sample input.

    sample_input = (
        "Generative AI has the potential to transform how organizations automate work, "
